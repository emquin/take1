<p>If you're not getting enough sleep, there are many poor health consequences that can vary from general fatigue and irritability all the way to a risk of Type 2 diabetes and  a risk of heart disease. Sleep makes you feel better, but its importance goes way beyond just boosting your mood or banishing under-eye circles. Adequate sleep is a key part of a healthy lifestyle, and can benefit your heart, weight, mind, and more. What's more, if helps tremendously with mental health issues. Poor sleep is linked to heightened depression and anxiety. Your body does the majority of repair whilst sleeping; it is actually working at its hardest. This means that we recommend 8-10 hours a night. If you have trouble with insomnia and sleep deprivation, we suggest turning all screens and digital equipment off an hour before you go to bed. Try to avoid caffeine (tea, coffee, sodas) 3 hours before going to sleep. Make sure the conditions in your room are quiet and dark, and at the temperature you prefer. If it's too hot, open the windows or turn on a fan. If it's too cold, wear thicker pajamas or grab more blankets. These will all ensure you have a healthy, deep night of sleep. </p>
