<p>There are many benefits to eating well. A healthy diet provides vitamins and minerals which boost immunity and protect the body against certain diseases. A healthy diet also provides energy to complete the day and feel less tired. It also helps to achieve an adequate body weight, however, if you believe you could be suffering from an eating disorder, it's important to reach out to someone you trust and contact a professional in order to receive the help you need.
In order to achieve a balanced diet you should aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 portions of fruit or veg daily. Fruit and veg provide vital vitamins and minerals, and there is also evidence proving that eating your 5-a-day lowers the risk of many major diseases.</li>
<li>Starch. Meals should be based on these food, which include potatoes, bread and pasta. Like fruit and veg, they provide vitamins as well as fibre.</li>
<li>Dairy. These include cheese, yogurt and milk, which contains sources of protein and calcium, to keep bones healthy.</li>
<li>Meat/beans/eggs/fish. These contain a range of vitamins and minerals, however some types can contain high levels of fat, so limit these.</li>
<li>Fat/sugar. It is important to have some fat in your diet, however too much fat can increase cholesterol, which causes heart disease.</li>
</ul>
